## 3D Printer

*3D printing is FUN.*

### Model
[Ultimaker 2](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-2)

### Usage Summary
Use 3D Modeling software such as [Sketchup](http://www.sketchup.com) or [Fusion 360](http://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/) to export .stl files.  Use the printer software, [Cura](), to import .stl files, adjust print settings, and save .gcode to the printer's SD card.  Use the scroll button on the printer to print from the SD card.

###Putting a File on the SD Card

To eject the SD card from Ultimaker press down until a click sounds and pull out the SD card. Never eject the card during a print. Once the card is connected to your device and a .stl file is loaded and configured onto [Cura](), navigate to "File", "Save GCode", and save  to SD card named "ULTIMAKER" or an SD card of your choice.

###Turning on the 3D Printer

The 3D printer has a switch on the back to the right of the plastic spool which turns the Ultimaker on and off.

###Printing a File

####Safety

During a print, the nozel that extrudes the material gets hot enough to melt your skin. Never touch it. Similarly, the building plate heats up for a plate. Be careful not to touch it. Touching the build plate may move it out of the calibrated position.

####Preparing the 3D Printer

Be sure that there is a thin layer of glue on the 3D printer to ensure that the 3D print does not move around during the printing process. If there is already a layer of glue, do not apply more. Applying too much glue cause cause the print to be very difficult to remove off the build plate.

####Loading the File

Once the Ultimaker is turned on, rotate the dial to the right of the display to highlight "PRINT" in the top left corner of the display. To select "PRINT", press down on the dial. Once the display shows a list of files of the 3D print, rotate the dial to navigate to your file and select the file by pressing down on the dial.

####During a Print

Once a file is selected, the nozel and the build plate will begin heating up until they are at the proper tempurature for the print to begin. Once the Ultimaker is ready to print, it will automatically begin. Many prints can take a long time, be prepared to be patient. Also, remember not to touch the nozel or the build plate during a print.

####Removing a Print

A print is only ready once the display indicates so. Even though the build plate lowers from the printing position, it is still cooling down and must cool down before you remove the print. Once the print is ready to be removed, use the scraper on the side of the Ultimaker to lift the print off the build plate. Clean up any excess material from the 3D printer. If the print is difficult to remove from the plate, that is because you added too much glue. Go call Mr. Kelley. Be sure to reset the printer to its original condition when you are done.
